# Lessons from four years of undergraduate

(...) Still a work in progress

1. Focus on school, don't worry about part-time work or all that

Domain expertise is key. Focus on mastery.

2. Have fun. Build a large network of genuine friends and relationships. Go to that party

3. Connections make the world go round. And it will make your internship / FT hunt so much easier

4. Go for that exchange. Maybe spend a little more time if possible. And talk to the exchangers in your school as well

5. Changed my life many times.

6. Build worldliness. Go for that Argentine Tango or Taekwondo class

7. Intern for many different verticals. Don't farm a specific vertical just cause it's easier

8. Optimise for impact. And remember to stress your impact done to bosses regularly

9. Please stay in a student dorm or hostel if possible within your means

Learn to talk everyday.

9. Say hi to that person in the lift

I greatly regret not doing this more.

10. Lead a project from scratch

You will learn a lot about management, failure, conflict resolution, ability to sustain, and more. All successful individuals need to be able to Ideate, Strategise, Execute, and Sustain.
